# Root Cause Analysis for Cloud Microservices

## Overview
This project aims to enhance anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) within cloud microservices by leveraging advanced data processing techniques and AI models. We focus on synthetic data generation, hybrid search strategies, knowledge graph integrations, and dual-prompt strategies for comprehensive anomaly detection and diagnosis.

## Research Goals
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generate synthetic datasets to mimic real operational scenarios for robust testing.
- **Hybrid Search Implementation**: Use Pinecone for optimizing data retrieval through both term-based and vector-based searches.
- **Knowledge Graph Augmentation**: Utilize Neo4j to structure complex relationships among microservices for improved analysis.
- **Dual Prompt Strategy for Anomaly Detection**: Employ dual-prompt techniques to provide detailed insights into microservice interactions and dependencies.

## Dataset
- **Transformed Petshop Dataset**: 210 rows and 9 columns, featuring consolidated metrics and a simplified data structure suitable for machine learning applications.
- **Synthetic Datasets**: Designed to replicate realistic operational challenges for effective anomaly detection testing.

## Technologies Used
- **Pinecone**: For efficient vector-based and term-based search functionalities.
- **Neo4j**: To manage complex data relationships within a graph database, enhancing RCA capabilities.
- **LangChain and Hugging Face Models**: For generating dynamic queries and contextual data handling through advanced NLP.
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas for data manipulation, PyTorch for model training, and Scikit-learn for data analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Use real operational metrics to create a baseline for synthetic data generation.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Apply machine learning models, such as Isolation Forest, to detect anomalies.
3. **RCA with LLM**: Utilize language models to analyze and generate insights based on the anomalies detected.
4. **Evaluation**: Systematically evaluate the models using precision and recall metrics, comparing the outputs against ground truth data.
